DISCLAIMER
==========

The orca part of the logo was mainly sketched out from a work of Vadim Carazan, which
was originally a logo he created for a marketing consulting company called "Orca Online
Marketing".

This logo is solely used for this specific repo and is and will not be for
commercial use. I found this logo from a quick "orca logo" google image search, and was
fascinated by it's design and color scheme, thought it would be nice to incorporate
with the "HT32 logo" from Holtek Semiconductor. That being said, the "HT32 logo" does
not appear to be a registered trademark of Holtek or have any copyrights involved.
Despite all above, I wholeheartedly respect the hard work of both Mr.Carazan and Holtek 
Semiconductor. If you feel that I have voilated your hard work or by any means infringe 
trademark right, do tell me right away, and I will take off the logo immediately.

此圖示只用於這個教學 repo，不會有任何營利用途。這個圖示是我當初使用 "orca logo" 關鍵字搜尋 Google
而來的。當下看到覺得整體設計跟配色都非常好看，心想如果跟盛群半導體公司的 "HT32" 圖示結合在一起應該會
別有設計感。特別註明，"HT32" 圖示貌似不是盛群半導體公司的商標。但儘管如此，我完全尊重及敬佩
Mr.Carazan 和盛群半導體公司的努力，如果有任何覺得侵犯到智慧財產權的話還煩請告知，我會馬上撤下它。
